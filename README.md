# ðŸ’» Console Text Editor ðŸ’»

Welcome to my terminal text editor project! ðŸš€ This project is a labor of love, created purely for fun and learning. I'm following the guide at [viewsourcecode.org](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html) to build a basic text editor from scratch. Here's what you need to know:

## Project Overview

- **Purpose**: To explore low-level concepts and understand the inner workings of basic text editors.
- **Motivation**: I'm passionate about learning how software tools function at a fundamental level.
- **Guide**: I'm following the step-by-step guide provided by [viewsourcecode.org](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html).

## Features

1. **Minimalistic Design**: My text editor will focus on essential features without unnecessary complexity.
2. **Keyboard Input Handling**: I'll implement keyboard input handling for text editing.
3. **Syntax Highlighting (Optional)**: If time permits, I'll add basic syntax highlighting.
